# ⏰ AVR-Based Alarm Clock (CodeVision + Proteus)

> 🕒 **Note:** This project was originally developed in **May 2020** and uploaded to GitHub in **October 2025** for portfolio and documentation purposes.

This embedded system project implements a functional **alarm clock** using **AVR microcontrollers**, programmed in **C** with **CodeVisionAVR IDE** and fully simulated in **Proteus**. It demonstrates key concepts in microcontroller programming, peripheral interfacing, and real-time embedded logic.

The system includes:

- 🕓 **Time Display** – Real-time clock shown on 16x2 LCD  
- 🔔 **Alarm Functionality** – User-defined alarm time with buzzer activation  
- 🎛️ **Button Controls** – Set time and alarm using push buttons  
- 🔌 **Peripheral Integration** – LCD, buzzer, buttons, and timer modules  
- 🧪 **Simulation** – Fully tested and visualized in Proteus environment
